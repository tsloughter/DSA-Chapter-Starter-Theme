# DSA San Diego

DSA San Diego is a chapter of the [Democratic Socialists of America](http://dsausa.org), the largest socialist organization in the USA. Our members are building progressive movements for social change in San Diego while establishing an openly democratic socialist presence in our communities and politics.

Democratic Socialists believe that both the economy and society should be run democraticallyâ€”to meet public needs, not to make profits for a few.

Please [join DSA](http://dsausa.org/join) as we work to help build a better and more just world for all.
