# DSA {Chapter Name}

DSA {Chapter Name} is a chapter of the [Democratic Socialists of America](http://dsausa.org), the largest socialist organization in the USA. Our members are building progressive movements for social change in {Region} while establishing an openly democratic socialist presence in {Area} communities and politics.

Democratic Socialists believe that both the economy and society should be run democratically—to meet public needs, not to make profits for a few.

Please [join DSA](http://dsausa.org/join) as we work to help build a better and more just world for all.
